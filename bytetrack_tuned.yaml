# ByteTrack configuration tuned for better tracking in multi-person scenarios
# Lower thresholds to detect and track people more consistently

tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection confidence thresholds (SENSITIVE for 2 people in clip 0!)
track_high_thresh: 0.30   # Default: 0.5 → Low to catch both people
track_low_thresh: 0.02    # Default: 0.1 → Low to recover lost tracks
new_track_thresh: 0.55    # Default: 0.6 → Moderate to create tracks for 2nd person

# Tracking parameters
track_buffer: 180        # Default: 30 → 3x longer to keep tracks alive
match_thresh: 0.75        # Default: 0.8 → Balanced to avoid over-merging 2 people
frame_rate: 30            # Set to your video FPS
fuse_score: True          # Fuse detection scores with IOU for matching

# Additional parameters
# These control how aggressively ByteTrack creates and maintains tracks
min_box_area: 10          # Minimum bounding box area
aspect_ratio_thresh: 1.6  # Maximum aspect ratio for valid detections
